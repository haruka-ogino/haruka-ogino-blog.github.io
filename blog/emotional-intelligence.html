        <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a measure of a person's intellectual and
          cognitive, such as problem-solving, logical reasoning, memory,
          mathematical ability, and linguistic comprehension. Meanwhile,
          <span class="bold">Emotional Quotient</span> (EQ) is a measure of
          emotional intelligence. This refers to the ability to recognise,
          understand and manage one's own emotions, along with the ability to
          recognise, understand and influence the emotions of others.

        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>
          Some psychologists believe that standard measures of intelligence,
          such as IQ, are too narrow and do not encompass the full range of
          human intelligence. Some experts believe that the ability to
          understand and express emotions can play an equal, if not more
          important, role in how people fare in life than IQ.
          <br /><br />
          Individuals with higher EI have been found to report lower levels of
          stress and higher levels of happiness, indicating that the ability to
          regulate perceived stress directly impacts satisfaction.
          <br /><br />Having a high EQ in the workplace can help you to build
          relationships, reduce team stress, defuse conflict and improve job
          satisfaction. The intelligent use of emotions is a fundamental
          mechanism in psychological adaptation and wellbeing.<br /><br />In my
          own life, I believe working to improve my EQ will help me lead a
          fulfilling life, both personally and professionally. As we spend the
          majority of our waking hours Monday to Friday at work, I believe it is
          highly important to be able to manage stress at work and feel positive
          about those around you.
