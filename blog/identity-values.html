          A situation where you have made an ethical decision & a situation
          where I tried to work productively with others, but there was
          resistance or tension.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I used to be a site engineer in the construction of major
          infrastructure here in Auckland. About nine months after starting my
          first job out of university, I was assigned an unexperienced crew to
          build a noise wall. It was difficult working with them from the
          beginning due to the lack of experience, not only on their part, but
          also mine. This often resulted in us working into the late afternoon
          after all the other crews had gone home.
        </p>
        <p>
          One particular day, we were still very much in the middle of a task
          when an issue arose. I knew what the right thing to do was – to
          essentially undo some of the progress we had made that day. Something
          that I knew the crew would not want to hear.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other option would have been to continue on building this portion
          wrong, and dealing with the issue set in structural concrete tomorrow,
          which would make today a good day and would avoid direct conflict with
          my crew.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided it was important to speak up and be honest. I gave the
          instructions to my crew, as the engineer in charge. However, they did
          not like it and did not want to listen to me, no matter how much I
          insisted on these instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realised that they would not be listening to me. I decided the best
          thing to do was to call for back-up. I called over to my foreman, who
          was not involved in this noise wall at all but did sit above anyone
          from the crew working on this noise wall and happened to be working
          only a few hundred metres away from us. As soon as he walked over, he
          agreed with me and gave them the same instructions I had previously
          given them. It was then that they complied.
        </p>
        <p>
          I now see that there were two ethical dilemmas involved in this
          situation for me. The first being the decision to ensure the wall was
          build correctly, as per the plans. The second was standing my ground
          as a young female in the construction industry which was not easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember back then, I felt sad and somewhat ashamed that 1) this
          situation happened at all, where we started to deviate from the design
          and 2) that I needed someone else in order for the crew to listen to
          me. I think I can now see the situation for what it was – an
          unexperienced team trying to work together, and more seasoned workers
          not wanting to listen to someone half their age and female. I am proud
          that despite feeling inadequate at the time, I ensured my job was done
          well, with honesty, integrity, passion and courage.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the strategies when dealing with people who believe they know
          best, I have learnt a lot. I learnt a lot in this first job about how
          you can phrase things in such a way to make people feel like decisions
          have been made collectively, with them included in the decision-making
          process. I think I probably came across confrontational due to the
          stress and high stakes of the situation. Despite already knowing a
          little about how to best deal with difficult people, I was not able to
          put it to practice in this instance.

      <div class="culture">
        <h2>
          How my culture and the people around me have influenced my values and
          identity.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Being a first-generation immigrant to parent to have immigrated to not
          one, but two countries, assimilating two cultures completely different
          from their own, I think kindness is very important. Everyone has their
          own struggles and showing compassion for others is what being human is
          about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like I said in my story about my time as a site engineer, I have
          learnt to pick my battles and know when you must have the courage to
          put your foot down and stand up for what you believe is right.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an immigrant woman, values like kindness, love and honesty come
          quite naturally to me. However, courage, which I believe to be equally
          important, is sometimes harder and I have consciously work on it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, having been given the opportunities I have in life, even if my
          life is far from perfect, I can’t help but feel a great deal of
          appreciation for what I have - both in material possessions,
          experiences and knowledge, and who I have become because of these
          opportunities.

      <div class="strengths">
        <h2>My strengths will support me in my learning journey.</h2>
        <p>
          Honesty, compassion, kindness and appreciation are some of my
          strengths. I believe this will allow me to relate to the people I come
          in contact with and build strong relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also always looking for improvement and don’t believe myself to
          be a master of anything. I believe humility and recognising there is
          room to grow is key in becoming someone who always looks to better
          themselves and learn new things. This mindset comes in handy when
          studying as I am keen to learn from others and gain new skills.

      <div class="limitations">
        <h2>
          My limitations, in terms of learning and career development, may
          affect my learning journey in several ways.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I struggle with time-management and have spent more than the
          recommended time on tasks as per the timebox. I am using the Pomodoro
          method to work on this and become more productive. I am trying to
          fixate on things less.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also can get frustrated when I don’t understand something which can
          lead to me spending too much time on it. It also brings about feelings
          of self-doubt. I have already experienced this, and I have found that
          all I can do for now is simply keep going despite these feelings
          arising.
