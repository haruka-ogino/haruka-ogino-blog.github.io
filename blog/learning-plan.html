    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
    <div class="blog-entry">
      <h2>My long-term goals and career pathway</h2>
      <p>
        I want to have a career in tech. I want to work in an industry that is
        dynamic, always looking to improve. I want to continue to learn and be
        active in encouraging women of colour to participate. I want to work in
        an industry that excites me.
      </p>

      <h2>My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
      <p>
        I think one of my strengths is that I am thorough. However, I have to be
        careful as this can quickly turn into bad management so I am trying to
        walk that fine line, trying to understand concepts, while not fixating
        on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also know some of my weak points, such as time management, which
        allows me to look out for them. I am keeping my eye on my timer as I
        have the Toggl desktop app going every time I am working.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accepting that some things may be hard to understand and not getting
        frustrated/dealing with the frustration is something I am working on.
      </p>

      <h2>Some skills I want to develop while at Dev Academy</h2>
      <p>
        I want to develop confidence in myself and my abilities. I also
        desperately want to become good at time-management and am actively
        working on it.
      </p>

      <h2>How I will manage my workload in this programme...</h2>
      <p>
        I struggle putting myself out there so I want to be a bit more outspoken
        than I have been in the past on discord and group discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have already started making a conscious effort to do this more in our
        homegroup meetings.
      </p>
      <p>
        When things start to get difficult and busy, I will take short breaks
        and remind myself that this part of the learning process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will also work on weekend as required in order to achieve my goals.
      </p>

      <h2>Seeking help in a timely way</h2>
      <p>
        I commit to reach out for help to facilitators and my peers if I get
        stuck on something for longer than 20min.
      </p>

      <h2>My expectations from the facilitation team</h2>
      <p>
        I want to receive feedback on my code; I want to know if I seem to
        misunderstand concepts, areas of improvement (such as conciseness), etc.
      </p>

      <h2>My schedule</h2>
      <p>
        During foundations, I am the sole carer of my puppy, so I while I do not
        have any block-out times during work hours, I have to take some longer
        breaks during the day to play with her and keep her busy. I make up for
        these by working longer day and some Saturday mornings.
