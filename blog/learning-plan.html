      <h2>My long-term goals and career pathway</h2>
      <p>
        In the long term, I want to make this my primary life-long career. As a
        lover of maths and problem solving, I want to pursue a career that
        involves these. I also love Japanese, and hope to one day work a job
        that can combine all my passions into one.
        <br /><br />
        I also really want to get involved in female in tech groups, like I have
        been in civil engineer. Connecting with other women in the industry,
        having mentors, giving insight to younger females pursuing their
        careers, are all very important to me.
      </p>

      <h2>My strengths and limitations while at Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        I previously described being thorough as one of my strengths, while also
        expressing concern as it could often also become bad time management. I
        am now feeling like I am becoming better at time management; not
        dwelling on specific concepts, but instead finding a balance between
        spending enough time to understand concepts 'enough' - about 80%. The
        toggle desktop app along with the timeboxes on the handbook have been
        great at helping me keep track of the time I spend on every task.
        <br /><br />
        I had also stated that I could easily become frustrated when I struggled
        with something. However, after learning about the growth mindset and
        neuroplasticity, I am feeling much more positive when I encounter
        struggles. I am keeping the mindset of 'not yet' and reminding myself
        that you do not become good at something overnight. And that that
        doesn't have to reflect negative on your intelligence or effort. Having
        this mindset, does not mean that everything will be easy and there won't
        be time of struggle and frustration, I just feel better equipped to
        handle these.
        <br /><br />
        I will keep working on these newfound strengths as I am not 100%
        confident in them, I just feel like I am turning these from weaknesses
        to strengths through conscious effort.
      </p>

      <h2>My biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        Something that I am a little concerned about is the amount of time we
        are to dedicate to Bootcamp. I have a puppy that required a lot of
        attention. I also have a partner who is extremely understanding, that I
        would like to spend time with.<br /><br />
        I am thinking of working extra hard on weekdays, do a few hours on
        Saturdays too, and minimal work on Sundays to catch up on chores and
        have some social life too.<br /><br />
        I want to give Bootcamp my all and really make the most of it, so I am
        concerned about whether I will be able to have a balanced life. However,
        since it is a 9 week Bootcamp, I feel like I will need to prioritise the
        coursework over other aspects of my life.
      </p>

      <h2>
        The non-technical skills - human skills - I would like to see developed
        in myself while at Dev Academy
      </h2>
      <p>
        I want to be able to collaborate better in groups by speaking my mind.
        In the past, while working in groups, I have felt like my voice isn't
        heard. I have often felt out of place being the only female around and
        it is not a nice feeling. I would like to make myself heard without
        letting other people talk over me or disregard my ideas.
        <br /><br />
        Along with this, come leadership skills. In the past, I have always held
        back due to feeling scared of coming across as bossy, but I want to move
        away from those beliefs and allow myself to develop leadership skills.
      </p>

      <h2>My expectations from the Bootcamp team</h2>
      <p>
        I want feedback regarding both my 'Core' and 'Tech' skills. Feedback to
        me would include areas of improvement on each, some insight into
        particular strengths would be helpful too.<br />
        <br />
        Regular feedback and check-ins are something I am really hoping for.
      </p>

      <h2>Expectations of myself</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I should be fully committed to the Bootcamp and work hard to meet my
          goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          I want to keep on top of things via priming before the following
          week's content and using my time wisely.
        </li>
        <li>
          I also will fully commit to the job application process like I have in
          the past in engineering.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will ask for help after trying something for 30 min - with maybe
          around 5 min of helplessness before reaching out - and trying the
          ruber ducky debugging method before doing so!
        </li>
        <li>
          I want to build relationships wih my peers so that we can help build
          each other up.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My long-term goals and career pathway</h2>
      <p>
        I want to have a career in tech. I want to work in an industry that is
        dynamic, always looking to improve. I want to continue to learn and be
        active in encouraging women of colour to participate. I want to work in
        an industry that excites me.
      </p>

      <h2>My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
      <p>
        I think one of my strengths is that I am thorough. However, I have to be
        careful as this can quickly turn into bad management so I am trying to
        walk that fine line, trying to understand concepts, while not fixating
        on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also know some of my weak points, such as time management, which
        allows me to look out for them. I am keeping my eye on my timer as I
        have the Toggl desktop app going every time I am working.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accepting that some things may be hard to understand and not getting
        frustrated/dealing with the frustration is something I am working on.
      </p>

      <h2>Some skills I want to develop while at Dev Academy</h2>
      <p>
        I want to develop confidence in myself and my abilities. I also
        desperately want to become good at time-management and am actively
        working on it.
      </p>

      <h2>How I will manage my workload in this programme...</h2>
      <p>
        I struggle putting myself out there so I want to be a bit more outspoken
        than I have been in the past on discord and group discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have already started making a conscious effort to do this more in our
        homegroup meetings.
      </p>
      <p>
        When things start to get difficult and busy, I will take short breaks
        and remind myself that this part of the learning process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will also work on weekend as required in order to achieve my goals.
      </p>

      <h2>Seeking help in a timely way</h2>
      <p>
        I commit to reach out for help to facilitators and my peers if I get
        stuck on something for longer than 20min.
      </p>

      <h2>My expectations from the facilitation team</h2>
      <p>
        I want to receive feedback on my code; I want to know if I seem to
        misunderstand concepts, areas of improvement (such as conciseness), etc.
      </p>

      <h2>My schedule</h2>
      <p>
        During foundations, I am the sole carer of my puppy, so I while I do not
        have any block-out times during work hours, I have to take some longer
        breaks during the day to play with her and keep her busy. I make up for
        these by working longer day and some Saturday mornings.
