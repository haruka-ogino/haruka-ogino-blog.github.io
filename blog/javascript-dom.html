  <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>
  <div class="blog-entry">
    <div>
      <h2>JavaScript, HTML and CSS</h2>
      <p>
        Let's start with an analogy to explain the relationship between
        these.<br /><br />
        Let's think of Matakana Village Farmer's Market, where people gather to
        buy local products, have a meal, or even watch live performances.<br /><br />
        In this scenario
        <span class="bold">HTML will determine the layout of the market.</span>
        This would include, the location of the stalls, tables and benches, and
        where designated walkways lie.<br /><br />
        Next, <span class="bold">CSS would provide the visual theme;</span> the
        wooden elements on the stalls that give the Matakana Market that rustic
        NZ feel. The colours, different styles on each stall, the writing styles
        on the vendors' signs! It gives life to the Market.<br /><br />
        <span class="bold"
          >JavaScript can be thought of as all the interactions</span
        >
        that take place. For example, when the magician performing asks for a
        volunteer to participate in his performance, this interaction would be
        facilited by JavaScript.
        <br /><br />
        All three of these could be seen working together when a customer goes
        to buy a savoury crepe from a stall. While JavaScript would be analogous
        to human interactions involved, including taking the order and handling
        the payments, HTML and CSS would dictate how the physical set up is
        structured and what it looks like.<br />
        This might me the display of the menu items, the cash register itself,
        and where the papers containing ne orders to be made are placed.
      </p>

      <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Control flow refers to the order in which statements are executed on a
        document. Meanwhile, loops are structures that allow the repetition of
        instruction a determined number of times.<br /><br />
        We can use analogies again to simplify these and make them easy to
        understand. Let's think of when we have to go get groceries.<br /><br />
        On your drive to the grocery store, you might encounter some traffic.
        You reach a give way sign. If you the road is clear and safe, you
        continue to drive on. However, if it is unsafe to continue driving, you
        stop until it is safe to continue your journey. In this scenario, the
        give way sign determines the <span class="bold">control flow</span> of
        your actions.<br /><br />
        Once you have arrived to the grocery store, have got your trolley ready
        to go, you look at your shopping list and determine where to start.
        <span class="bold"
          >Mr. Loop can help pick out the items on your grocery list.</span
        >
        Mr. Loop will ask you if there are still items to be picked up after
        picking each item - as long as the answer to this is yes, he will
        endeavour to keep picking your items. Once all items have been picked,
        he will stop and let you take over the trolley to pay. This is exactly
        how loops work. They repeat an action, or a set of actions, given some
        parameters.
      </p>

      <h2>The DOM</h2>
      <p>
        The DOM stands for <span class="bold">'Document Object Model'</span> and
        represents the
        <span class="bold"
          >structured content of an HTML document as a tree structure</span
        >.<br /><br />
        <span class="bold">Interacting with and inspecting the DOM</span> is
        commonly done using browser developer tools. A common way developers to
        access these is by right-clicking on an existing webpage and selecting
        'Inspect'. This allows developers to view and manipulate the DOM
        structure in real time.<br /><br />
        <span class="bold">DOM interactions</span> allow us to easily read,
        access, and update contents of the HTML document dynamically, with
        JavaScript often being used for these interactions.<br /><br />
        The changes made to the DOM when using browser tools are only
        <span class="bold">temporary changes</span> and only affect the current
        session. This is done as a security measure which prevents unauthorised
        modifications.<br /><br />
        However, DOM manipulation can also create
        <span class="bold">permanent changes</span> through JavaScript. These
        changes might include modifying the content, structure, or style of a
        webpage.

      <h2>Accessing Arrays and Objects</h2>
      <p>
        Objects: you can use objectname.keyname to access specific information.
        - come back to this. use
        atlasInfo-countries-(capitalCity,population,landMass)? as example for
        objects. Array: list of countries?
