        <h2>When blocked on a simple problem...</h2>
        <p>
          While working on the fizzbuzz exercise, I was unable to pass the tests
          but did not know why as I thought my code was correct.
          <br /><br />
          In my problem solving approach, I tried the rubber ducky debuggin
          method, where I talked through my solution, and the problem outloud as
          if talking to someone. Finally, I used google, which was when I
          realised I was not 'returning' the solution, but instead assigning the
          solution to a variable.
          <br /><br />
          Throughout the process, I felt a little inadequate as I could not see
          the issue on my own. After finding the answer, I felt a little silly.
          <br /><br />However, I think this was due to my lack of experience
          coding and I hope to keep practicing writing code in order to get
          better. <br /><br />
          I am learning to use the resources available. I used to be quite
          against using chatGPT, for example. However, I find it very helpful to
          debug when really stuck. It can also give you tips, wihtout spoiling
          the answer if you ask for that.<br /><br />I am also now very aware
          that you need to 'return' your answer, and am in the process of
          knowing when to do what.<br /><br />Lastly, I think I am still on
          somewhat of a fixed mindset so I feel like now that I know this, I can
          put more effort to changing my mindset from "I can't do this task on
          my own" to "I can't do this task on my own yet".

        <h2>Occasion when you legantly solved a problem...</h2>
        <p>
          While solving the gradebook exercise, I was quite intimidated at first
          with each of the tasks.
          <br /><br />
          I used pseudocode, a combination of on-paper and on my actual code.
          While planning on each of the steps, I always used the 'try something'
          method before going back to look at my notes and ensure I used the
          methods correctly and the right syntax for these.<br /><br />I used
          the examples discussed on the JS methods sections to help me solve the
          gradebook section efficiently. Although I did have to use Google and
          some ChatGPT for some of it. <br /><br />
          During the process, I mostly felt adequate and motivated to work hard.
          However, there was still some self-doubt regarding the fact that I had
          to turn to Google and ChatGPT. There was one particular section where
          I expected the changes suggested by chatGPT to be small, but my entire
          syntax for that method was completely wrong.
          <br /><br />
          I learnt in this, that I need to celebrate any small win, and practice
          and review both the content and exercises done. I learnt that I am
          learning some new things to use in my code which was a pleasant
          surprise as up until now, I have felt as though I have just been using
          methods I already knew from before this course and was very
          uncomfortable with the methods I have never seen before. However, as I
          was pushed to use these in the gradebook exercise, I realised that I
          can already apply some of them somewhat confidently.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>
          Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
          techniques/processes:
        </h2>
        <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
        <p>
          I feel quite happy using it. Although I do prefer pen and paper. I had
          the great experience of witnessing people who are good in my one
          software paper in university use pen and paper to plan their code and
          saw how helpful it could be so I have been using this method to tackle
          problems myself.<br /><br />I prefer using the comments on my code to
          explain the funtions and pieces of code after they have been written -
          for both my learning in the moment and future reference.
        </p>
        <h3>Trying something</h3>
        <p>
          This is almost always my step two after pseudocode. I always like to
          just try something and see what happens to better test myself and
          learn what I do know and what I do not know yet.
        </p>
        <h3>Rubber ducky debugging method</h3>
        <p>
          Again, I feel like I try to often use it. I find it works most
          effectively when I am talking to a real human - I think this might be
          because I make the effort to explain it in a way another human could
          understand. Whereas, if it is my dog or an inanimate object, I migth
          quickly talk through my explanation as they do not truly understand -
          something to work on.
        </p>
        <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
        <p>
          This is not something I am incredibly used to. However, I am working
          on it and I believe improving.
        </p>
        <h3>Console.logging</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy using this, however, sometimes in this sprint, I struggled to
          actually find the results of my console.log(). I only recently bought
          a mac as I needed a new laptop ahead of this course and wanted to try
          one, and I am still getting to know how it works as opposed to
          Windows.
        </p>
        <h3>Googling</h3>
        <p>
          I do feel quite confident using this. However, I often find that
          chatGPT can give better results explaining JS methods, as you can
          dictate the level of detail you want, ask for clarification on
          concepts you might be uncertain about, and can ask for a seemingly
          infinite number of examples for any given method.<br /><br />I
          sometimes feel I might become over-relient on it, whereas before, I
          was completely against it so I am trying to find that balance.
        </p>
        <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
        <p>
          This is not something I have done directly, as I do not know them
          well, or outside the discord chat/weekly voice calls for my Homegroup.
          I think this will likely change once we start meeting in person during
          the bootcamp.
        </p>
        <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
        <p>
          I am pretty happy doing this - although I mostly used the group chat
          which makes me a bit uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This is an area where I definitely need to put more effort, make time
          for it and actually do it! It is very hard for me as it is definitely
          not something I have done before, so it still feels unnatural and I do
          not feel confident doing so.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>
          Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
        </h2>
        <p>
          During the 'manipulating objects' section, I was really struggling as
          I was getting an error relating to 'Jest' on my terminal when trying
          to run my code to test it. I tried to fix the error myself using
          Google and ChatGPT. I was hesitant to ask on Discord as it was almost
          8pm and it is always a bit scary for me to post on there. However, I
          felt like I had to other choice, so I did ask on discord.<br /><br />I
          was frustrated, as due to this error, I thought I couldn't even move
          on to the next tasks.<br /><br />After waiting for a reply for a
          while, I decided to calm down, stop panicking, and think about how I
          could fix it on my own. As the terminal told me where the issues where
          on my code - the lines we are not supposed to touch! - I went on
          gitHub to find the original code from the Dev Academy. There, I found
          that the lines above and below my code had changed from when I first
          forked them. I promptly copied and pasted and my issue was solved!<br /><br />
          I think I would be less reluctant to ask for help if I was not in a
          state of panic and was able to exhaust all other options before doing
          so. I enjoy problem solving instead of being given answers, so I think
          this may also be attributed to my 'fixed mindset'. I do not have a
          'growth mindset' YET.
