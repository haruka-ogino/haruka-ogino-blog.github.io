        <h2>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I have learnt how capable I can be of change. For example, I tend to
            spend too long on tasks, but using the Toggle app to track this, I
            have found myself being much more mindful of it.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have also seen the power of the mindset. I had tried to practice
            something similar in the past but learning about neuroplasticity and
            this concept, I found myself to be much more confident in my
            struggle and hard work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lastly, I was reminded of the concept of continuous improvement in
            all aspects of life - social, personal and professional.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Empathy allows for better collaboration between team members where
          collaborators can better understand each other.<br /><br />Self-awareness
          reveals a lot of insight to oneself; such as strengths, weaknesses and
          knowing what one needs. <br /><br />Values are what make people who
          they are.

        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          While I have always thought about the idea of continuous improvement
          in personal growth as something I want to practice, I realised I have
          not really been doing this in an effective manner. I have mostly
          stayed in my comfort zone but I feel like I am finally getting out of
          this and challenging myself.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          When I have done journalling in the past, it felt like I could keep
          tyoing forever. For that reason, I have been scared to start as I
          don't want to end up writing for hours everyday.<br /><br />In saying
          this, I am realising the solution is liekly to set a timer and only
          journal for that set time - which I would like to try.<br /><br />
          I did somewhat struggle making time for it as well. However, I was not
          too worried, as I did do the prep modules, reading those parts
          thorughly and making notes along the way which allowed me to focus a
          bit more on the Tech Modules during the sprints.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think this is probably the case as it is something a lot of people
          and education institutions neglect. However, just as we have been
          reminded so far in Foundations, I have also found that employers care
          about well-rounded people, and not the best technical skills.
          <br /><br />
          At almost all my previous civil engineering jobs, they were always
          running courses on soft skills, such as leadership, time-management
          and a positive attitude.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It does not feel like a waste at all. I thoroughly enjoyed learning
          about effective ways to problem solve, the theory of neuroplasticity
          and of course, the growth mindset.<br /><br />
          Taking the time to do these, instead of only programming, is important
          to develop other parts of the brain that also need it.
