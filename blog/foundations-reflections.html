          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          While I have always thought about the idea of continuous improvement
          in personal growth as something I want to practice, I realised I have
          not really been doing this in an effective manner. I have mostly
          stayed in my comfort zone but I feel like I am finally getting out of
          this and challenging myself.

          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?

          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It does not feel like a waste at all. I thoroughly enjoyed learning
          about effective ways to problem solve, the theory of neuroplasticity
          and of course, the growth mindset.<br /><br />
          Taking the time to do these, instead of only programming, I believe
          taps into other parts of the brain that also need development.
