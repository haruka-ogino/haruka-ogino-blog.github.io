            How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit
            people?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Understanding the idea of neuroplasticity, the idea that the brain
            is malleable, and that intelligence can be acquired, not just have
            been born with, empowers learners to apply themselves. This
            realisation can help unleash people’s true potential without being
            held back by their perceived intelligence limitations.
            <br /><br />It also provides some ideas as to some of the best ways
            to study; namely, repeated practice and learning in the context of
            existing knowledge. Reminding learners this is a powerful aid in
            their motivation and morale.

            How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your
            own benefit?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Firstly, reminding myself of the malleable brain concept by
            reviewing my blog post and the notes on the student portal will be
            helpful to me as self-doubt can often come about along with feelings
            of not being smart enough.
            <br /><br />
            Moreover, I want to practice coding as well as engaging with the
            core material we are learning often – continuing to put these to
            practice and engage with the course content to get a better grasp of
            it and strengthen ‘pathways’ in my brain.
            <br /><br />
            I will also try to relate difficult concepts to things I am already
            familiar with to try learn in context.
            <br /><br />

          <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Physical activity strengthens the brain. Exercise — aerobic
              exercise in particular — can lead to improvements in cognitive
              abilities like learning and memory. Exercise also helps improve
              fine motor coordination and brain connectivity, and may protect
              against cognitive decline.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Create art – such as drawing and painting can enhance creativity
              and improve cognitive abilities. They can also help create new
              pathways and strengthen existing ones.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Practicing a new language – research shows that learning a new
              language can boost grey matter density in the brain. Grey matter
              houses areas associated with attention, language, memory, emotions
              and motor skills.

            to be interesting as learning about the ways in which I can improve
            my neuroplasticity makes me want to make time for activities I
            enjoy, but struggle to prioritise. I want to get back to practicing
            and learning more Japanese, exercising, and making art and music.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>What it is and why it is relevant?</h3>
          <p>
            The growth mindset is the belief that your abilities are not fixed
            but can change.
            <br /><br />
            "Science has also revealed that our beliefs about ourselves, what we
            think and feel about our abilities, and our beliefs about success
            and failure hugely influence our outcomes."
            <br /><br />
            Having a growth mindset involves:
            <ul>
             <li>Embracing challenges</li>
             <li>Persisting in obstacles</li>
             <li>Seeing effort as necessary</li>
             <li>Learning from feedback</li>
             <li>Being inspired by others</li>
             <li>Celebrating not knowing - as an opportunity to grow</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>
            Did anything surprise you and change for you in this exploration?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The studies used as examples and proof surprised me as it showed how
            much of an impact a growth mindset can have on outcomes.
            <br /><br />
            I have struggled a lot with believing in myself and abilities in the
            past, so I want to continue to remind myself of this.

          <h3>
            How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Understanding that the brain is malleable and capable of tremendous
            change allows people to exert themselves in a way that allows them
            to grow and learn. Knowing that your abilities and skills are not
            fixed, and that you don’t have to have natural talent in order to be
            good at something, gives people enough hope to be able to believe in
            themselves and change.
            <br /><br />
            Conquering small tasks, and succeeding repeatedly can help grow this
            confidence.
            <br /><br />
            Changing language from 'can’t' or 'try' to 'can’t yet' and 'will
            do'.
